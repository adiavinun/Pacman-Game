## Developers:
  * Adi Avinun
  * Nicole Dezoraive


## Demo:
[Pacman Game by Adi & Nicole](https://sise-web-development-environments.github.io/assignment2-adi-nicole/)

## Additional functionality:

  * We added two types of candies: Cherry and Strawberry, that appear and dissapear throughout the game. When the pacman eats one of the candies, 30 points are added to the score.
  * We added a clock on the board. When the pacman eats the clock, 20 seconds are added to the game.
